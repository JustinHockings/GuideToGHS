    <h3>This site was created by Justin Hockings and Rafael Markus as their Term 1 Information and Software Technology assignment in 2023. This site was created to help new students get acquainted with the school, and to update current students on some basic concepts that may have been overlooked or forgotten.</h3>
    <h3>A huge thank you goes to the Glenwood High School Library staff for providing the homepage images, and also to Mr Leaver for providing helpful images for our page information. This website was created with Microsoft Visual Studio Code (VSC), utilising HTML and CSS coding languages. Other pieces of software were also used, such as Adobe Photoshop and the Live Server plugin for VSC which allowed us to have real-time monitoring of the site's design during development.</h3>
